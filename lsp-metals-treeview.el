;; lsp-metals treeview ui client - handles a treeview for project tree,
;; compilation tree etc.
;; See the Metals treeview provider spec for further details:
;;  https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/tree-view-protocol.html
;;
;; Current treeview interaction is:
;;   tab  key to expand/collapse nodes which is default treemacs behaviour.
;;   ret  will execute the command associated with the current node via Metals.
;;        Note you need -Dmetals.execute-client-command enabled for this to work
;;        and may require you to upgrade Metals post 0.7 for Emacs.
;;
;;   mouse left double click - will execute the command on a node.
;;
;; Metals allows classes to be expanded and the action executed on the same
;; node - metals.goto (goto definition) we can't therefore use return to
;; expand/collapse and execute actions.  The existing implementation provides
;; a simple starting point to test the treeview with metals and we can evolve
;; to a Hydra like interface to provide a richer keyboard experience in future.
